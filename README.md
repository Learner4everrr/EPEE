# EPEE

Welcome! Here is the code for the paper **EPEE: Towards Efficient and Effective Foundation Models in Biomedicine**.

For the NLP part, I modified the code from [PCEE](https://github.com/michael-wzhu/PCEE-BERT) and add new model: ALBERT and GPT2.

For the CV part, inspired by PCEE, I implemented the code for the ViT model.
